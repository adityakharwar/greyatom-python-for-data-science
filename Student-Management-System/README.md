### Project Overview

 STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM----It tells how we can handle different management problems while evaluating tests or we can even calculate the outcome of the work done by different people(for # begineers)


### Learnings from the project

 Learning from the project:
1) Data Wrangling 2) Lists 3) Dictionary 4) Different functions in Python 5) Strings.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 APPROACH TAKEN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
1. Creating lists and printing it.
2. Updation & deletion from list(using python function)
3. creating Dictionary       4. mathematical operation (eg. total percentage)       5. finding the maximum score among students(using Max function)      6. printing name of student in  certificate with high score with whitespace and strings.


### Challenges faced

 CHALLENGES FACED
1) Invalid syntax for Max function -> correct way is : max_scored=max(dictionary.key=dictionary.get)print(max_scored)


### Additional pointers

 ADDITIONAL POINTS:
While doing this project we can add different functions like sum(), remove(), append(), format() etc. we can use different mathematicals operators ,try different methods to implement it. It is very easy.
